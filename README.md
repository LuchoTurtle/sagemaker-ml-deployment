# Deploying ML/DL models in AWS SageMaker

This notebook is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree and it provides my solution to the last project of the course where it details the development and the deployment of an LSTM in AWS SageMaker for a simple sentimental analysis web app based on string provided. This notebook guides you the AWS console and the procedures to deploy a lambda function, an API gateway and training/infering/deploying a model that yields prediction, all the while making use of the S3 storage for the dataset.

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.
